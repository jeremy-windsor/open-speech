| T3 | Technical terms | Say "MPLS, SRv6, BGP, NETCONF" | Acronyms transcribed correctly | |
| T4 | Background noise | Say phrase with ambient noise | Transcript still accurate | |
| T5 | API endpoint | `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` with WAV file | Returns `{"text":"..."}` | |

### 2.2 Model Switching
| # | Test | Steps | Expected | Pass/Fail |
|---|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| T6 | Load tiny model | Models tab → Systran/faster-whisper-tiny → Download → Load | Loads successfully | |
| T7 | Transcribe on tiny | Switch to tiny, transcribe phrase | Faster, slightly less accurate | |
| T8 | Unload model | Unload tiny | Memory freed, model gone from loaded list | |
| T9 | Switch back to large | Load large-v3-turbo again | Loads, transcription quality restored | |

| K7 | Download audio | Generate then click download | MP3/WAV file downloads | |

### 3.2 Piper Backend
**Setup:** Install Provider → Load a piper model

| # | Test | Steps | Expected | Pass/Fail |
|---|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| P1 | Load piper model | Models → en_US-lessac-medium → Install Provider → Download → Load | Loads successfully | |
| P2 | Basic synthesis | Switch backend to piper → type text → Generate | Audio plays | |
| P3 | Blend controls hidden | Check Speak tab with piper active | Voice blend UI NOT visible | |
| P4 | British voice | Load en_GB-alan-medium → Generate | British accent audible | |

### 3.3 Pocket TTS Backend (pending Forge build)

| PT1 | Install provider | Install Provider for pocket-tts | Completes without error | |
| PT2 | Load model | Download → Load | Loads on CPU | |
| PT3 | Synthesis speed | Generate 30s of speech, time it | < 15s generation time | |
| PT4 | No GPU needed | Check docker logs | No CUDA errors, runs on CPU | |
| PT5 | Voice options | Check speaker dropdown | Available voices listed | |

### 3.4 Qwen3 Backend (GPU required)
**Setup:** Install Provider → Load qwen3 model

| # | Test | Steps | Expected | Pass/Fail |
