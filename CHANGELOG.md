# Changelog

All notable changes to Open Speech are documented here.
Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Product documentation now consistently describes Open Speech as a speech-model harness; `server`
  remains reserved for its concrete HTTP, WebSocket, and Wyoming transports.
- TTS capabilities and voice catalogs can now be resolved per model through a versioned isolated-worker
  contract, with provider choices scoped to the selected model.

### Added
- Optional, disposable Qwen3-TTS 0.6B worker for preset-voice and reference-cloning canary tests.
- Provider-neutral voice-reference transcripts and content hashes.
- Repeatable one-shot and Live Reader TTS benchmark script.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added
- Live Reader WebSocket at `/v1/audio/speech/stream` for incremental text input and PCM16 audio output.
- Browser controls for reading typed or pasted text from the cursor, reading a complete document,
  pausing, resuming, stopping, and clearing.
- Book, responsive phrase, and completed-word reading modes.
- Playback acknowledgements, bounded buffering, cancellation generations, source offsets, idle flushing,
  Markdown cleanup, HTML entity decoding, and safe fenced-code handling.
- Live speech support in the TypeScript client and a raw Python streaming example.

### Changed
- Natural book mode now keeps comma-separated clauses together and retains a short pause at synthesis
  boundaries instead of treating every comma as a standalone utterance.
- Docker dependency layers are ordered ahead of application source so ordinary code rebuilds reuse the
  expensive CUDA, Torch, and provider layers.
- Live Reader controls now remain next to the text input at normal laptop resolutions.
- Maintained documentation now describes current behavior only; obsolete phase plans, machine-specific
  test plans, and point-in-time reviews were removed from the working tree.

### Fixed
- Live Reader flow control now counts Unicode code points consistently between JavaScript and Python, so
  emoji and other supplementary characters cannot leave browser input permanently blocked.
- Piper Live Reader sessions now advertise the selected model's actual sample rate.
- HTTP requests carrying WebSocket upgrade headers can no longer bypass HTTP authentication middleware.
- Voice blends and speech input handling received additional validation and resource bounds.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Batch Transcription API** — async multi-file transcription with job queue
  - `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions/batch` — submit up to 20 audio files
  - `GET /v1/audio/jobs` — list jobs with optional status filter
  - `GET /v1/audio/jobs/{id}` — full job detail including results
  - `GET /v1/audio/jobs/{id}/result` — results array (409 if not done yet)
  - `DELETE /v1/audio/jobs/{id}` — cancel or delete jobs
- SQLite-backed batch job store (`src/batch/store.py`)
- Async batch worker (`src/batch/worker.py`) with configurable concurrency
- Per-file error isolation — one file failing doesn't abort the batch
- History integration — completed batch files auto-logged to STT history
- New config: `OS_BATCH_WORKERS` (default 2) — max concurrent batch jobs

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- Stabilized model availability, loading, download progress, and provider-missing states.
- Improved the model browser, audio waveform, mobile layout, and Piper catalog handling.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Persistent voice profiles and generation history.

  hardened model-management concurrency.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- Standardized HTTP error envelope across API and middleware responses to `{"error": "..."}`.
- Replaced ad-hoc `JSONResponse({"error": ...})` branches in TTS endpoints with `HTTPException` plus a unified exception handler.
- Synced README API endpoint table with all implemented routes in `src/main.py`.
- Added full OS_*/STT_*/TTS_* environment variable reference in README.
- Corrected README Qwen3 model IDs to match `src/model_registry.py` (`qwen3-tts/...`).
- Added missing `STT_MODEL_DIR` documentation entry to `.env.example`.
- Harmonized `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.cpu.yml`, and `docker-compose.gpu.yml` env coverage, ports, and volume mounts using non-root container paths.
- Expanded runtime tests for `src/streaming.py` session lifecycle, VAD flow, mid-stream disconnects, and error propagation.
